###  [The shell](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html)

* What is the shell?

* How to access a shell?

### Basic shell commands

```bash
pwd

ls -a

cd foo
cd ..
cd ~
cd /absolute/path
cd ../relative/path
cd ~/expandable/path
```

* Extensions may confuse you

Handy ways to write paths:

* Windows uses \
* Drag-and-drop insertes path
* Autocomplete with tab

Navigate the history:

* Repeat previous commands with up/down
* Search previous commands with ctrl + r

Help

### Help

* `man command`, `command --help`, and online help.

### Setup

* Overview different ways to
[setup](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.terminal#setup) a terminal and
data.

### Look and move around

```bash
# Print working directory
pwd

# List files and directories under the current working directory
ls

# Modify the output with flags. You may combine multiple flags
ls --all
ls -a

ls -al
ls -alt
ls -altr
ls -altrF

ls --help
```

Change to your home directory and explore it. This helps:

* Use autocomplete with Tab.
* Clear the terminal with clear (or ctrl + L).
* Reuse commands with Up/Down.

```bash
cd ~
```

* Explore lesson's data under ~/Desktop recursively.

```bash
ls -R
```

Explore the directories `.` and `..`.

```bash 
ls -a
ls .
ls ..
```

Explore one linking/linked directory.

```bash
ls -l
ls R
ls /cloud/lib
```

These three commands return the same. Which one is wold you say is:

* default?
* relative?
* special?
* absolute?

```bash
ls
ls .
ls ~
ls /home/rstudio-user
```

These two commands return something different expect at `/`. Why?

```bash
ls .
ls ..

cd /
ls .
ls ..
```
