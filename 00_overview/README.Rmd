# Overview

This meetup helps you understand what is the terminal, and why you might want
to use it. It overviews the entire series.

### Part 1:

Navigate your files system:

* Explore the lesson materials north-pacific-gyre/ with `ls` and `cd`.

Customize your shell:

* Tweak the shell's prompt.

Compose flags:

* Use a command with multiple flags combined: `ls -lr`.

Modify your file system:

* Create directories.
* Create, copy, move, edit, and remove files (DANGER!).

Compose commands, sort, and redirect results:

```bash
wc * -l | sort -n > result.txt
```

### Part 2:

* Find things in files with `grep`

```bash
grep "the" writing/haiku.txt
```

* Find files with `find`

```bash
find . -name "*.txt"
```

### Part 3:

* Iterate with `xargs` (or do it in a higher-level language)

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs wc -l
```

* Script with `alias` (or do it in a higher-level language)

```bash
alias rm="rm -i"
```
