The goal of this meetup is to help you understand and use the power of your
terminal.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* navigate to a file/directory
* create a file/directory
* check the length of a file
* chain commands together
* retrieve a set of files
* iterate over files
* run a shell script containing a pipeline

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who wants to understand the basics of the terminal, including developers
and analysts at 2DII and beyond.

## Why is this important?

> The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.
It has survived so long because it's a powerful tool that allows people to do
complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them
combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they
aren't typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is
fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing
resources.

## Syllabus

### Part 1: Working with files and directories

Objectives:

* Setup a terminal and the lesson data.
* Understand what is the terminal and why you may use it.
* Learn to move around your system.
* See the files and directories you have. 

XXXXXXX* How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?

* Create, copy, and delete files and directories.
* Edit files.

* Find files.
* Find things inside files.

### Part 2: Combining and repeating commands

Pipes and Filters:

* How can I combine existing commands to do new things?

Loops:

* How can I perform the same actions on many different files?

### Part 3: Reusing commands

Shell Scripts:

* How can I save and re-use commands?

## Setup

You may get a bash terminal and the lesson data in a number of ways:

* Follow the lesson's [setup](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).

* Use the terminal in [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). You may download
the lesson data into the Desktop folder in R with:

```r
# install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

use_course(
  url = "https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip", 
  destdir = "~/Desktop"
)
```

* Use the docker image `maurolepore/terminal` (includes the lesson's data) with:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti maurolepore/terminal
```
