The goal of this meetup is to help you understand and use the power of
your terminal.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   navigate to a file/directory
-   create a file/directory
-   check the length of a file
-   chain commands together
-   retrieve a set of files
-   iterate over files
-   run a shell script containing a pipeline

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who wants to understand the basics of the terminal, including
developers and analysts at 2DII and beyond.

## Why is this important?

> The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been
> alive. It has survived so long because it’s a powerful tool that
> allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More
> importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and
> automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over
> and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range
> of other powerful tools and computing resources.
